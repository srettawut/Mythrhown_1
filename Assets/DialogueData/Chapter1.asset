  - This city is called "Mythrhown". The city where there is no sun light.
  - I have arrived to this city 2 weeks ago....
  - and I have to say... I kinda like this city, people here are just different.
    Not same as my hometown at all.
  - I have a part time job at this little cafe here in the middle of the city.
  - You know... money don't make it's self.
  - There are many good things about this city but the downside iss this city is
    full of danger.
  - That is  because this city has no laws..
  - The only rule that everyone in this city know is that "Do not trust anyone"
  - But I already broke that rule by trusting someone..
  - And that person is of course.... "My BOSS"
  - CONTINUE IN CHAPTER 2...
